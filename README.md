===============================

To run this game just open index.html in your browser, this will start the game with the score 0.
Use keyboard arrows to move the player and, if you like to change character, press R key as many times
as necessary to select your favorite character. Every time you reach the water your score is increased
by one, and if a bug intercepts you, your score is reset.
